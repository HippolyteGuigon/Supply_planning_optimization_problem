# Supply_planning_optimization_problem
The goal of this repository is to implement a solution to the Supply Planning Optimization problem (https://towardsdatascience.com/supply-planning-using-linear-programming-with-python-bff2401bf270) 

Your supply chain comprises two factories, two distribution centers and 200 stores. Where must you allocate your stock to meet customers' demands and reduce transportation costs ?
